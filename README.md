# JpGui
A GUI program for the jpackage command line program in the Java JDK.

The GUI will help you create jpackage projects.  I displays command line fields alone with their help text as seen below.

This program can also generate script to run the jpackage command at the command line.

You can create scripts for both Windows and Linux on either the Windows platform or Linux platform.

The program can execute the script but only for the platform this GUI is running on.

If you have any suggestions or questions, please ask.
